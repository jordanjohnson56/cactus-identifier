# cactus-identifier
This project is a part of a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification) to teach a machine to recognize whether a picture contains a cactus or not. This is for training myself in machine learning and the goal is to use a convolutional neural network to generate the features and classify the images.

We'll see how this goes...
